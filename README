THANKS
SandMan       : Introducing me to the wide world of Backtrack, 
                   teaching me linux one bad command at a time.
ShamanVirtuel : Basic GUI design. SpoonWEP was a HUGE inspiration!
okra_man      : Came up with the idea for Injection Test option.
		    Also, he suggested a MAC changer option.
mrkazu        : Suggested channels that go up to 14 for European support. 
		    "These go to 11!"



      G R I M   W E P A



A WEP and WPA cracker for Linux.

Written in Java.
Open source.

Built for Backtrack 4 (Ubuntu).
Reported working on Auditor.

Utilizes aircrack-ng suite.
Required applications:
	airmon-ng
	aircrack-ng
	airodump-ng
	aireplay-ng
	packetforge-ng
	
also:	macchanger
	ifconfig


This program DOES NOT CRACK WEP OR WPA FOR YOU.
This program runs programs (such as aircrack-ng, aireplay-ng, airodump-ng, etc).
This program merely AUTOMATES the WEP/WPA cracking process.

This program uses the same cracking methods that SpoonWEP, SpoonWPA, and Gerix use(d).

If you don't know what this program does behind-the-scenes, then
  you should learn by cracking your own access point using command-line only.
A simple google search for 'aircrack fragmentation' will land on a tutorial.



[RECENT CHANGES]

v0.9 : 	Added injection-rate slider,
	Fixed a bunch of bugs (hopefully),
		- Fixed ability to 'start attack' with no target.
		- Worked on getting "Hide XTerms" to work.
			- Handshake capture and packet replay need airodump-ng visible.
	Included 'install.sh' for installation purposes;
		- to install, type ./install.sh install
	Working directory is now the location of the jar file,
		not wherever program was run from.
		works well with installation!
	


[TUTORIAL]

** Start Up **

To run GrimWepa, navigate to the JAR file in the console and type:

java -jar grimwepa_X.X.jar

(X.X being the version you have).
This will load the program and display the GUI within a few seconds.

When GrimWepa first loads, it will check if any devices are in Monitor Mode.
	Monitor mode is a state that some wifi cards can be in so they can
	collect data packets which are not destined for themselves.  This is
	crucial for receiving data packets to crack WEP and WPA access points.

If there are no found devices in monitor mode, GrimWepa will enumerate all 
	possible wifi devices and ask you to select a device to put into
	Monitor Mode.  Once you select a device and press "OK", GrimWepa will
	put the device into monitor mode using airmon-ng, then add it to the list
	of WiFi devices, automatically selecting the device it just put into MM.

Once we have a selected wifi device, we can begin to search for targets.

** Search **

Click the "Refresh Targets" button to begin the search for targets.  If you want
	to only search a specific channel, uncheck the "All Channels" option and 
	drag the slider to the channel you want to stay on.

After a few seconds (usually around 5), access points should appear in the list.
	Some people have reported that they get a FileNotFoundException printout
	in the console.  This is usually due to an invalid WiFi device selection.

Note: GrimWepa will display the airodump-ng window (minimized by default) in an 
	XTerm window.  You can view the airodump output by maximizing the window.
	GrimWepa will ONLY ADD WEP AND WPA/WPA2 access points to the list!
	If you are surrounded by OPEN networks and nothing else, the list will
	remain empty!

After you see your target in the list, click "Stop Refreshing", select your target,
	and depending on if your target is WPA or WEP, start the attack.

** Attacks **

WEP:
	There are 5 kinds of WEP attacks (Arp-replay, Chop-chop, Fragmentation, 
	Cafe-latte, and p0841).  Some attacks only work with certain access points 
	I have had lots of luck with ARP-replay (on an access point with activity) 
	and Fragmentation (on an access point with no clients/activity).  Your own
	wifi cards and access points will vary, so find a method that works for you.
	
	It is not necessary to change your MAC address ("Change MAC" button) to
	crack WEP sucessfully, but some routers may require it.  Use Change MAC if
	other methods are unsucessful.

WPA:
	We want to crack the WPA access point.
	To crack it, we need to get the 4-way handshake.
	To get the 4-way handshake, we need a client to connect to the access point.
	
	The Deauthentication attack will try to deauthenticate a client (if one is 
	selected) or the entire access point (if no client is selected).
	To increase your chances of getting a handshake, get as close as possible
	to the access point and wait for someone to connect.  If there's already
	a client connected, select their MAC address so GrimWepa will deauthenticate
	them, forcing them to reconnect, and forcing a handshake to be broadcasted.
	
	After a handshake is received, the "Start Cracking" will become enabled.
	You can type in the location of a password list you would like to use (path)
	or type the path to a non-existent file ('use_default_damnit') to force
	GrimWepa to use the default password list.  The default password list
	contains about 250,000 passwords (all over 8 characters in length) that I
	compiled from many different wordlists.  I know that Backtrack 4 has a
	wordlists folder located at /pentest/passwords/wordlists/ at least
	one file in there (darkc0de.lst).


Good luck!



[TROUBLESHOOTING]

    * Run as Root! I hate running executables as root, but I tried running 
	GrimWepa as an unprivileged user and was met with errors.
	
    * Are you booting from a DVD, USB, or is it installed on your system? 
	GrimWepa writes some files to the disk [temporarily] and a 
	DVD/non-persistent USB boot may cause the program to fail. 
	You could try running GrimWepa from the directory /ramdisk/, 
	where it should be able to save files -- Note: /ramdisk/ lets 
	you write and save data to the RAM, which will be wiped upon reboot.
	
    * Make sure you choose a Wifi card that can go into monitor mode. 
	Some wifi cards create a 'mon0' interface for a wifi card that is 
	in montior mode; You may want to try both the wlan# and mon# interfaces 
	until you find the right one.
	
    * Last possible check: To make sure airodump works with your wifi card, 
	try typing (in console): 
	"airodump-ng -w targets --output-format csv mon0"
	where mon0 is your wificard's interface. This is the command that 
	GrimWepa uses, and if targets-01.csv isn't created in the folder you 
	run it in, this could mean there is a write-permissions problem.




[SOURCE CODE]

Since GrimWepa is open-source, the code is available to everyone!
If you're new to java programming, then you should know that a
recent java compiler is required.  I used the Sun Java6 JDK.

A compiler isn't necessary to VIEW the source code, but it is
reqired to COMPILE the source code (if you make any changes).

To get the Sun Java6 JDK, type:
    apt-get install sun-java6-jdk


To download the source code, type:
    svn checkout http://grimwepa.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

To compile, navigate to trunk/ and type:
    javac test2.java

To run, type:
    java test2

If you want to join the team (so far it's just me) and help make GrimWepa better,
  shoot me an e-mail and I will add you to the members list 
    (so you can post commits and make revisions).
