= Donations for GrimWepa =

I can't stress this enough: *_I DON'T NEED MONEY!!!_*

If you enjoyed using GrimWepa and feel really guilty about not having to pay for it, then feel free to donate!

But remember:

== GrimWepa is FREE ==

Also, donating money will not change anything: please do not expect extra bug support, the ability to beta test the next version, or any other "perks".  Please only donate out of the kindness of your heart and only because you have money you are willing to part with.
