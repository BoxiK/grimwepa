#summary Information on the latest beta of Grim Wepa
#labels Featured

= This Version is Alpha, not Beta =

No one wants to test the latest alpha version of Grim Wepa.

If you want to help test and make Grim Wepa better (beta), then download the latest release from here:
http://grimwepa.googlecode.com/files/grimwepa1.10a2.jar
You can use this code to download and run it:
{{{
wget http://grimwepa.googlecode.com/files/grimwepa1.10a2.jar
java -jar grimwepa1.10a2.jar
}}}

This version (and future versions) will contain an installer within the program; so there is no longer a need for a 'grimstall.sh' script.

Please test as much as you can and send me bug reports / comments / suggestions to: derv82 at gmail

All suggestions, comments, and bug reports are appreciated!!!

= What's new in v1.10 =
	* splash screen
	* checks required/recommended apps at first load
	* install (and uninstall) from inside the app
		* default install directory: /pentest/wireless/grimwepa/
		* creates link in /usr/bin/
		* optional: create desktop shortcut
		* optional: create menu shortcut 
			* backtrack > radio network analysis > 80211 > cracking
	* faster + more stable monitor-mode checks, asks to take device out of monitor mode on exit
	* clients of target AP's sorted based on BSSID > user can only choose clients of a select AP
	* corrected some of the WEP attacks
	* new WPA cracking methods:
		* dictionary attack with pyrit (buggy, no output, but works!)
		* crunch wordlist passthrough > passes generated passwords straight into aircrack-ng/pyrit
		* wordlist generator -> give it a lot of wordlist files and it'll combine/sort/filter/de-duplicate
		* "online wpa cracker" -> directs browser to 2 online wpa key resolution services
		* note: pyrit attacks are experimental right now (no output, really slow, etc)
	* handshake gets stripped by pyrit if user has pyrit in their /usr/bin/ folder
		* also tries to strip handshake using tshark if pyrit isn't found
	* all handshakes are backed up to ::grimwepaPath::/hs/
		* removes spaces/non-alpha-numeric chars from name, stores it as that name.cap
		* for example: ssid "Netgear! 5831" would be stored as "Netgear5831.cap"
	* stored passwords (key tank):
		* remembers crack method, date, time, ssid, bssid, encryption type, and (for wep) pps
		* displays most-recently-cracked password first for multiple entries
		* ability to view & remove previously-cracked AP's
		* backwards compatible with grimwepa v1.0
		* converts hex to ascii when applicable
		* signs onto WEP and WPA1 encrypted access points using iwconfig

= Known Issues =

* your wireless card may not work; this is not my fault
	* i will not give support for hardware issues
* pyrit in this version is 'sketchy'
	* cannot run in an xterm window (no visual output)
	* the dump file gets updated every 10 min or so (infrequently)
	* (sometimes) waits for all input before it starts cracking,
		* ...meaning crunch passthrough takes a LONG time
* aircrack-ng is apparently 'unstable' with large wordlists (2GB +).

* intel 4965 chipset fix works for some, but not all. unable to test
* tested with aircrack-ng suite version 1.0 r1661
	* uses '--output-format csv' arguments with airodump-ng
	* older versions (BT3's) do not have this option
* directories with spaces in them have been buggy in the past
	* i tried fixing this bug in this version; I think it's fixed
* some people can't run grimwepa using the opensdk or openjdk for java
	* please use the java6 from sun!
	* to get the jdk, type:
		* apt-get install sun-java6-jdk
