= GRIM WEPA INSTALLATION GUIDE =

*STEP 0 : BEFORE* we start.
If, for some reason, you can not get internet access in BackTrack4, I can't help you : that's beyond the scope of these instructions. Also, if you are booting from a DVD, then the "installation" will not be permanent. If you don't fall into these two categories, installation of GrimWepa should be a breeze.  The first two steps are downloading grimwepa and the install.sh file, so if you already have those, skip to STEP 3!


*STEP 1 : DOWNLOAD* grimwepa to your harddrive.

Open a console (Terminal) window (it's the black-box icon near the menu button on the lower-left).
You should see a black background with text that says something like:
{{{
root@bt:~#
}}}
Note: If you're booting from VMWare, from an installation, or off of a USB, you should be fine and can ignore this paragraph and skip to the 'wget' code. However, if you are booting into BT4 using a bootable DVD, you MAY need to navigate to the directory /ramdisk/ so you can work with files not included on the DVD. Also, bootable DVD's and non-persistent USB sessions will wipe all the changes you make upon reboot. I don't know how to add GrimWepa as a module to the BT4 ISO file, so you'll have to do these steps below every time you boot into BT4.
Sorry!
To navigate to /ramdisk/, at the console, type:
{{{
cd /ramdisk/
}}}

To download grimwepa, type the following into the console:
{{{
wget http://grimwepa.googlecode.com/files/grimwepa_0.9.jar
}}}
Alternatively, you could copy that code and paste it into console using Shift+Insert. The wget command will download grimwepa to the current directory that console is in (usually the default is root). You should now see the file grimwepa_0.9.jar appear (next to other files/directories) when you type:
{{{
ls
}}}
Note: the first letter is a lower-case L, not a capital i.

After you have GrimWepa on your computer (or in RAM via the /ramdisk/ directory), you can move on.


*STEP 2 : DOWNLOAD* the install script (install.sh)

In the same console window that you downloaded grimwepa_0.9.jar in, type this:
{{{
wget http://grimwepa.googlecode.com/files/install.sh
}}}
This will download "install.sh", a shell script that will install GrimWepa to your system. You should now see both grimwepa_0.9.jar and install.sh when you type:
{{{
ls
}}}
You will need both of these files before moving on.


*STEP 3 : CHANGE PERMISSIONS* of the install script

We can't just run the shell file : we need to change the permissions before we can run it. To change the permissions, type this into the same console window:
{{{
chmod 755 install.sh
}}}
You won't see any output or confirmation, so just assume that the permissions were changed accordingly.


*STEP 4 : INSTALL!!!*

Now that we have grimwepa_0.9.jar and install.sh in the same folder, and the correct permissions for the install script, we can install it! In the same console that we've been typing in, type:
{{{
./install.sh install
}}}
You should see an output showing GrimWepa being installed. After the install script is done running, you can test if it worked by typing (into console):
{{{
grimwepa
}}}
GrimWepa should open up (after a few seconds), proving the installation was successful. GrimWepa should also be in your menu under "BackTrack > Radio Network Analysis > 80211 > Cracking". You can also run GrimWepa by typing "grimwepa" into any console anywhere!

If this installation guide doesn't work, or if I should add/change something (experts), let me know via e-mail so I can correct the problems. Hopefully there are no errors; if you have any, copy/paste the errors to me in an e-mail! I <3 bug reports

..........

*STEP 99 : UNINSTALL* GrimWepa 

So you enjoyed GrimWepa, but now you're grown up, tired of shoddily-automated scripts, and want to banish GrimWepa to the great /dev/null in the sky, eh?

To undo everything that the install script did (basically, to Uninstall GrimWepa), type:
{{{
./install.sh remove
}}}
You'll still have to delete the .jar file you downloaded manually:
{{{
rm grimwepa_0.9.jar
}}}

But you don't want to uninstall it... right? 


Thanks for using Grim Wepa!!!
