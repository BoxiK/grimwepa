thanks
----------------------
AIRCRACK-NG TEAM
	this program automates the wep/wpa cracking process 
used by the aircrack-ng suite. the aircrack-ng team have 
made an amazing, easy to use tool and i wrote a program 
that automates their tool. grim wepa would be nothing
without aircrack-ng!!!

SANDMAN
	he showed me backtrack, taught me linux, and showed me 
everything i know about network security.

SHAMANVIRTUEL
	author of the spoonwep/spoonwpa series. i've looked
up to SV for years. he heavily influenced me, which means 
he also had a huge influence on grim wepa -- like the GUI!

EVERYONE ELSE
	suggestions, beta testing, bug reports, etc:
		okra_man, mrkazu, Weasek, mixit, hmanxx, bobdamnit
	there's others, i just can't remember right now.
	thanks to everyone that helped make grimwepa what it is now.



specifications
----------------------
all of the required/recommended apps *should be* checked when
	the program is first loaded. if you are missing any of these
	apps, the program will alert you accordingly.

required applications:
	the aircrack-ng suite: (the body and head of grim wepa)
		-airmon-ng
		-aircrack-ng
		-airodump-ng
		-aireplay-ng
		-packetforge-ng
	
	macchanger - for client-based wep attacks
	ifconfig   - put device up/down
	iwconfig   - check for monitor mode, signing on
	sort       - for wordlist generation
	wpa_supplicant - sign on, intel4965 chipset workaround
	iwlist     - finding wpa encryption (before signing on)

the below apps aren't required, but grimwepa will use them if
they are found - just make sure there's a link in /usr/bin/

optional applications:
	wget   - for downloading wordlists
	tshark - strip the handshake from large capture files
	pyrit  - cracking, super-fast, gpu-style.
	crunch - generating passwords to passthrough to aircrack
	uniq   - for removing duplicates in wordlist generation
	pw-manager - for filtering passwords (wordlist generator)



change log
----------------------
v1.10:
	-splash screen
	-clients of target AP's sorted based on BSSID > user can only choose clients of a select AP
	-faster + more stable monitor-mode checks, asks to take device out of monitor mode on exit
	-new WPA cracking methods:
		- dictionary attack with pyrit (buggy, no output, but works!)
		- crunch wordlist passthrough > passes generated passwords straight into aircrack-ng/pyrit
		- wordlist generator -> give it a lot of wordlist files and it'll combine/sort/filter/de-duplicate
		- "online wpa cracker" -> directs browser to 2 online wpa key resolution services
		* note: pyrit attacks are experimental right now (no output, really slow, etc)
	-corrected some of the WEP attacks
	-handshake gets stripped by pyrit if user has pyrit in their /usr/bin/ folder
		- also tries to strip handshake using tshark if pyrit isn't found
	-all handshakes are backed up to ::grimwepaPath::/hs/
		- removes spaces/non-alpha-numeric chars from name, stores it as that name.cap
		- for example: ssid "Netgear! 5831" would be stored as "Netgear5831.cap"
	-stored passwords (key tank):
		- remembers crack method, date, time, ssid, bssid, encryption type, and pps (for wep)
		- displays most-recently-cracked password first for multiple entries
		- ability to view & remove previously-cracked AP's
		- backwards compatible with grimwepa v1.0
		- converts hex to ascii when applicable
		- signs onto WEP and WPA1 encrypted access points using iwconfig
	-install (and uninstall) from inside the app
		- default install directory: /pentest/wireless/grimwepa/
		- creates link in /usr/bin/
		- optional: create desktop shortcut
		- optional: create menu shortcut 
			- backtrack > radio network analysis > 80211 > cracking
	-verbose mode; outputs all executed commands to stdout
		- designed for debugging
		- start program with -v as an argument
		- ex: "grimwepa -v" or "java -jar grimwepa1.10a3.jar -v"


developmental changes in v1.1
-----------------------------
re-wrote the majority if the source code;
	- made it easier to read, follow, understand, and add to
	- "readExec()", "readFile()", "writeFile()" are the biggest changes
	- started naming conventions of classes GUI elements (less confusing).
broke up complex classes into separate classes; instead of test2.java, there's now:
	- Main.java - holds the main method
	- Gui.java - builds the Gui front end, all commands are ran via Methods---
	- Methods.java - where the program's functionality resides
	- threads are easily distinguishable from gui classes
	- attempt to reuse code as much as possible (threadWpaCracker is a good example)



known issues
----------------------
your wireless card may not work; this is not my fault.
	- you can solve your own hardware issues using google.
pyrit in this version is 'sketchy'.
	- it cannot run in an xterm window (no visual output)
	- the dump file gets updated about every 10 min (infrequent)
	- (sometimes) waits for all input before it starts cracking,
		...meaning crunch passthrough takes a LONG time.
aircrack-ng is apparently 'unstable' with large (2gb+) wordlists (untested)
intel 4965 chipset fix works for some, but not all.  (untestable)
designed using aircrack-ng suite version 1.0 r1661:
	- works with aircrack-ng version 1.1
	- uses '--output-format csv' arguments with airodump-ng
		- older versions (BT3's) do not have this option
directories with spaces in them have been buggy in the past
	- i tried fixing this bug in this version; I think it's fixed.
you can't run the program using the openjre for java
	- please use the java6 from sun!
	- to get the jre, type:
			apt-get install sun-java6-jre
	- you can open grimwepa by right-clicking the .jar file, 
			click 'Open With...', then 'Sun Java 6 Runtime'


v1.10 alpha 4 fixes / updates
-----------------------------
	- Subversion support! :D
	- auto-signon checkbox for wep and wpa cracking attacks
	- fixed signon for WPA (now handles WPA1, WPA2, and WPA1+2)
		- uses iwlist to figure out encryption of access point
	- new wep attack: 'passive capture'
		- does not attempt any fake-auth or any aireplay attacks
		- listens to a network passively (unintrusively).
		- useful when network is generating lots of traffic (netflix)
	- 'download wordlist' option for wordlist generator
		- user selects which files to download (8 total)
		- downloads from googlecode page
		- stores in ::grimwepapath::/wordlists/
	- refreshing targets doesn't lose selected access point (small fix)

v1.10 alpha 3 fixes / updates
-----------------------------
	- verbose mode, displays every command-line executed in the console.
		- enable with '-v' argument
		- ex: "java -jar grimwepa1.10a3.jar -v" or "grimwepa -v"
	- fixed bug with airmon-ng: attempted to view airmon-ng errors in iwconfig
	- fixed gaping hole with injection test (huge programming error, whoops!)
	- check if user is root, os is "Linux", at every boot; shutdown if not.

v1.10 alpha 2 fixes / updates
-----------------------------
	- double-checked arpreplay, chopchp, fragmentation, and p0841 attacks; they work!
	- fixed wep display: key was not showing first letter
	- fixed wep fake authentication error! fuck yea!
	- split 'wordlist generator' into: 'wordlist generator' (actual) and 'crunch passthrough' (original)
	- added lots of 'killall' commands in an attempt to terminate zombie processes
		- ex: after listening for targets, 'killall airodump-ng' is called
		- this isn't very elegant code, but people have complained that processes aren't terminating
		- this only attempts to kill wep/wpa-cracking-specific apps, like pyrit, aireplay airodump, aircrack, etc
	- added required/recommended file check at first load (only)
		- checks /usr/bin, /usr/sbin/ and /sbin/ for files used by grim wepa


TODO: 	GuiWordlistGen -> download wordlists from google code page! :D
			uses wget,
			stores in grimwepa working directory,
			adds to list automagically
			** need some good lists, upload to google code, THEN write this shit **
		
		upgrade button in Install window - checks for updates, upgrades automatically
